// Your boss loves emojis and he asked you to help write a banner generator 
// that can make every sentence you type in look 'user-friendly':
// Their idea of user-friendly is:
// Each word must start with an smily emoji (:smiley:).
// Each word must have their first letter capitalized.
// Banner cannot be more than 10 words
// Banner must be a string
//Examples:
// "Hello world" ==> ":smiley: Hello :smiley: World"
// "This banner has one too many words to be a banner" ==> false
// ["Hello World"] ==> false
